Awake on my airplane
Awake on my airplane
My skin is bear
My skin is theirs
Awake on my airplane
Awake on my airplane
My skin is bare
My skin is theirs
I feel like a newborn
Awake on my airplane
Awake on my airplane
I feel so real
Could you take my picture

'Cuz I won't remember
Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember
Yeah
I don't believe in
I don't believe in

In your sanctity
Your privacy
I don't believe in

I don't believe in
Sanctity
A hypocrisy
Could everyone agree that
No one should be left alone
And I feel like a newborn
Kicking and screaming
Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember
Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember

Yeah
Hey dad what do you think about your son now
Ah hey dad what do you think about your son now

'Cuz I won't remember
Could you take my picture

'Cuz I won't remember
Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember
Yeah
Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember
Could you take my picture

'Cuz I won't remember
Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember

Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember

Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember
Could you take my picture
'Cuz I won't remember
